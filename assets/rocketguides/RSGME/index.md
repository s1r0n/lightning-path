# Rocket Scientistsâ€™ Guide to Authentic Spirituality (RSGAS)

The Rocket Scientistsâ€™ Guide to Authentic Spirituality is a foundational work in the Lightning Path series that reclaims the core of spiritual development from centuries of ideological corruption and mystification. Anchored in empirically grounded concepts like Connection, Healing, and the Seven Pillars of Authentic Spirituality, RSGAS systematically differentiates between spiritual systems that heal and empower versus those that confuse and colonize. This guide challenges prevailing spiritual narratives shaped by disconnection, elite manipulation, and mental illness masquerading as mysticism, offering instead a clear standard for evaluating spiritual practices and institutions. It is essential reading for those seeking to establish a science of human spirituality rooted in measurable outcomes, spiritual integrity, and collective liberation.
