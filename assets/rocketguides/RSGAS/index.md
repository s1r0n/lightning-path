# Rocket Scientistsâ€™ Guide to Money and the Economy (RSGME)

The Rocket Scientistsâ€™ Guide to Money and the Economy is a deconstructive economic primer written through the critical lens of the Lightning Path. It interrogates the origins, functions, and effects of money, capital accumulation, and the modern economic apparatus, exposing how abstracted labour, debt regimes, and elite economic interests create and sustain systemic inequality and social disempowerment. By tracing the ideological and structural mechanics of the global "regime of accumulation," RSGME reveals the deep entanglements between economic institutions and spiritual, psychological, and physical disconnection. This guide serves as both a critical educational resource and a call to consciousnessâ€”offering tools to resist indoctrination, dismantle economic myths, and reimagine value systems based on equity, healing, and planetary sustainability.
