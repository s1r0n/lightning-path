# Lightning Path Survey Project
The Lightning Path Survey Project is an evolving research initiative developed to advance our empirical understanding of Connection Experience, spiritual narrative, and consciousness development. Rooted in the principles of Authentic Spirituality and framed within the Lightning Path Human Development Framework, this project seeks to systematically collect and analyze data related to spiritual awakening, mystical insight, and personal transformation.

These surveys are designed to support the ongoing construction of a scientifically rigorous, decolonized, and healing-centered model of human spirituality and Connection. By participating, you contribute to the development of empirically grounded theory and improve our collective understanding of spiritual development free from ideological distortion, religious mystification, and colonial caricature.
