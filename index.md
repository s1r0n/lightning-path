## Welcome to the Lightning Path GitHub Repository

Welcome. You've arrived at the digital hub of the **Lightning Path**—a bold, integrative [Knowledge System](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Knowledge_System) designed to support human [Healing](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Healing), [Connection](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Connection), and planetary transformation.

At its core, the Lightning Path offers a structured and accessible [Human Development Framework](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Human_Development_Framework) that challenges the dysfunctions of our current [Regime of Accumulation](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Regime_of_Accumulation). By combining insights from psychology, sociology, mysticism, and decolonial theory, it offers a clear and empirically grounded path toward what we call [Harmonic Social Structures](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Harmonic_Social_Structure)—systems intentionally built to support [Human Flourishing](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Human_Flourishing), unlock [Human Potential](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Human_Potential), and promote planetary regeneration.

 This repository contains the documentation, data, and software supporting our educational and transformational goals, including workbooks, curriculum tools, and research publications. Whether you're a student, educator, researcher, or planetary steward, we invite you to explore the materials, challenge what doesn’t make sense, and contribute to a shared project of conscious planetary evolution.

If that sounds ambitious—yes, it is. But we believe the stakes are high enough to warrant nothing less.

If you have any questions or think you might like to help out in some way, contact the principle Architect and project steward, Mike Sosteric (mikes@athabascau.ca)
