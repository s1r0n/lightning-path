# Everybody Has a Connection Experience

This article by Dr. Mike Sosteric presents empirical and theoretical evidence supporting the prevalence of [Connection Experience](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Connection_Experience) in the general population.

A valuable read for situating personal experiences within a broader scientific and developmental framework.
