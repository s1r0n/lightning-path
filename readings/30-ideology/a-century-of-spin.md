# A Century of Spin  
**How Public Relations Became the Cutting Edge of Corporate Power**  
By David Miller and William Dinan

## Summary

*A Century of Spin* is a foundational text for understanding the ideological dimension of the [Regime of Accumulation](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Regime_of_Accumulation). It meticulously documents the rise of the public relations industry as an intentional tool of elite ideological controlâ€”what the LP identifies as **ideological contamination** and a core mechanism of [Toxic Socialization](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Symbol_Factories). Rather than merely managing reputations, PR functions to manufacture public compliance, defend corporate and capitalist power, and neutralize resistance. The work reinforces the assertion that most mass consciousness is shaped not by truth, but by manipulation embedded in language, symbols, and spectacle originating in **[Ideological Institutions](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Ideological_Institution)** operating under elite control.

This book should be read alongside core LP texts on **[Ideology](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Ideology)**, **[Disconnection](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Disconnection)**, and **[Authentic Spirituality](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Authentic_SPirituality)**, as it illustrates the pervasive intentionality behind the distortion of human perception and belief systems. It is essential for anyone seeking to deconstruct the false narratives of capitalist modernity and support genuine **healing**, **connection**, and **decolonization**.
