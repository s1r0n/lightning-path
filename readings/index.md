## LP Readings

This directory contains selected readings that align with and support the core concepts of the Lightning Path. Each text has been chosen for its relevance to LP themes like healing, connection, decolonization, and the exposure of ideological and structural distortions. These works help deepen understanding, provide critical context, and strengthen the scientific and sociological foundations of the LP framework.
