The Lightning Path Allegories are symbolic, narrative, and poetic illustrations of the Avatar.Global cosmology—stories designed to express deep metaphysical and psychological truths in accessible, emotionally resonant, and pedagogically powerful form. Drawing from the foundational Lightning Path Human Development Framework, the allegories articulate core themes such as the nature of Consciousness, the Fall into Materiality, the process of Disconnection and Reconnection, and the Path of Healing, Awakening, and Ascension.

They serve not only as mythopoetic expressions of Lightning Path ontology, but also as tools of transformation—counter-narratives designed to disrupt colonial, ideological distortion and support human reconnection with the Fabric of Consciousness.

This repository provides access to the allegories in editable and structured formats, facilitating integration into media, curriculum, and outreach projects aligned with the goals of Avatar.Global.
